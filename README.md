## Etch-a-Sketch Game Overview

Welcome to the Etch-a-Sketch game, a nostalgic trip back to one of my favorite childhood toys, now brought to life through code! In this project, we'll be using Python's Turtle graphics library to create a digital version of the classic drawing toy.

### Features:

1. **Drawing with Turtle**: Use the arrow keys to move the turtle forwards and backwards, and rotate it clockwise and anticlockwise to draw lines or shapes.
2. **Creating Art**: Let your creativity flow as you use the turtle to draw anything you can imagine, from simple lines to intricate patterns.

### How to Play:

1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the turtle around the screen.
3. Experiment with different movements to create your masterpiece!
